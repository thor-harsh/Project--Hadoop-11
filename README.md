  **In this project we will be working on creating the workflow for OOZIE and its gonna be an amazing skills to have in your toolkit.**.<br></br>

Lets learn about **OOZIE** first before diving into its workflow..<br></br>

**What is OOZIE?**<br></br>
Oozie is a workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs.<br></br>

Oozie Workflow jobs are Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs) of actions.<br></br>

Oozie Coordinator jobs are recurrent Oozie Workflow jobs triggered by time (frequency) and data availability.<br></br>

Oozie is integrated with the rest of the Hadoop stack supporting several types of Hadoop jobs out of the box (such as Java map-reduce, Streaming map-reduce, Pig, Hive, Sqoop and Distcp) as well as system specific jobs (such as Java programs and shell scripts).<br></br>

Oozie is a scalable, reliable and extensible system.<br></br>
