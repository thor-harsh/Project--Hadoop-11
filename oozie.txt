#oozie is a system for running and scheduling hadoop tasks.


#The oozie workflows contains two actions:

#Use sqoop to extract movie data from mysql

#Then hive script will create tables based on that extract


#Putting workflow.xml in hdfs
hadoop fs -put workflow.xml /user/maria_dev

#Putting Hive script in hdfs
hadoop fs -put oldmovies.sql /user/maria_dev

#Also install mysql connector for connecting it with sqoop and and we install that library into oozie so that it can see it
hadoop fs -put /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar /user/oozie/share/lib/2023022424

#Now restart and it the command prompt write the command to start oozie
#So it is telling that we want to run oozie at this ip address and then the path of job.properties on local file system and not on hdfs
#Run to actually start the workflow right now

oozie job --oozie http://localhost:11000/oozie -config /home/maria_dev/job.properties run
